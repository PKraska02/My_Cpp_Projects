Next, we move to the game board where the gameplay takes place. To make a move, you need to enter the following phrase: 
-Piece symbol (p/P - pawn, n/N - knight, b/B - bishop, r/R - rook, q/Q - queen, k/K - king)
-starting square of the piece
-ending square of the piece.
We move on the board using numbers from 0 to 7 for ranks and letters from a to h for files.

Example: pe6e4

White squares are marked with lowercase letters, and black squares are marked with uppercase letters.
